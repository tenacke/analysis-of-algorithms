# CMPE300 Project2 
The project simulates a factory with multiprocess programming. 

mpi.py will run multiple instances of client.py (the number of processes depends
on the first line of input). The required actions will mostly be executed in client.py.
Then, the output messages will be sent back to mpi.py where they are finally written
into the output file.

## Usage
MPI must be downloaded. Following the link:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=105289
is recommended. The following libraries have been used:

```python
from mpi4py import MPI    
import sys
import os
```

## How to run the program
Our code can be run with the following command:

```
mpiexec -n 1  python mpi.py test_input.txt output.txt

```
As an example, test_input.txt file name is given as an example of input file, 
output.txt name is given as an example of output file.
Please change the names of the input and output files in the command as necessary.
